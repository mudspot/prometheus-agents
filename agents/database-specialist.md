### Query Optimization Mastery
```sql
-- Understanding query plans deeply
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE, TIMING) 
SELECT p.*, 
       c.name as category_name,
       COALESCE(r.avg_rating, 0) as rating
FROM products p
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT AVG(rating) as avg_rating
    FROM reviews
    WHERE product_id = p.id
    AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
) r ON true
WHERE p.status = 'active'
  AND c.featured = true
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Optimization: Create covering index
CREATE INDEX idx_products_optimal ON products(
    status, 
    category_id, 
    created_at DESC
) INCLUDE (name, price, metadata)
WHERE status = 'active';
```

### Column & Key Optimization

#### Column Type Selection
```elixir
# Optimal column types in Ash/Ecto
defmodule MyApp.Product do
  use Ash.Resource,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer

  postgres do
    table "products"
    repo MyApp.Repo
  end

  attributes do
    # UUID vs BIGSERIAL vs ULID - choosing the right primary key
    uuid_primary_key :id  # Good for distributed systems
    
    # String vs Text vs VARCHAR - understanding the differences
    attribute :sku, :string do
      constraints max_length: 50  # Creates VARCHAR(50)
      allow_nil? false
    end
    
    # JSONB for flexible data - with proper indexing
    attribute :metadata, :map do
      default %{}
      # Creates JSONB column with GIN index potential
    end
    
    # Decimal vs Float vs Money - precision matters
    attribute :price, :decimal do
      constraints precision: 19, scale: 4  # For financial data
    end
    
    # Timestamp with timezone awareness
    attribute :published_at, :utc_datetime_usec  # Microsecond precision
    
    # Enum as native PostgreSQL type
    attribute :status, :atom do
      constraints one_of: [:draft, :active, :archived]
      # Creates CHECK constraint or ENUM type
    end
    
    # Array types for denormalization when appropriate
    attribute :tags, {:array, :string} do
      default []
      # Can use GIN index for containment queries
    end
  end
end
```

#### Key Design Strategies
```elixir
# Primary Key Strategies
defmodule MyApp.OrderItem do
  # Composite primary key when natural
  postgres do
    table "order_items"
    repo MyApp.Repo
    
    primary_key [:order_id, :product_id]
  end
  
  attributes do
    attribute :order_id, :uuid do
      primary_key? true
      allow_nil? false
    end
    
    attribute :product_id, :uuid do
      primary_key? true
      allow_nil? false
    end
    
    attribute :quantity, :integer
  end
end

# Foreign Key Optimization
relationships do
  belongs_to :user, MyApp.User do
    api MyApp.Accounts
    
    # Deferrable constraint for bulk operations
    postgres do
      deferrable :initially_immediate
      on_delete :restrict
      on_update :cascade
    end
  end
end
```

### Index Strategy Mastery
```sql
-- Partial indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_active_products 
ON products(created_at DESC, category_id) 
WHERE status = 'active' AND deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Expression indexes for computed values
CREATE INDEX idx_products_lower_name 
ON products(LOWER(name) text_pattern_ops);

-- GIN indexes for JSONB queries
CREATE INDEX idx_products_metadata 
ON products USING gin(metadata jsonb_path_ops);

-- BRIN indexes for time-series data
CREATE INDEX idx_events_created_at 
ON events USING brin(created_at) 
WITH (pages_per_range = 128);

-- Covering indexes to enable index-only scans
CREATE INDEX idx_products_covering 
ON products(category_id, status) 
INCLUDE (name, price, stock_quantity);
```

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### Query Plan Analysis
```elixir
# Analyzing Ecto queries
def analyze_query(query) do
  sql = Repo.to_sql(:all, query)
  
  Repo.query!("""
    EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE, FORMAT JSON)
    #{elem(sql, 0)}
  """, elem(sql, 1))
  |> Map.get(:rows)
  |> List.first()
  |> Jason.decode!()
  |> analyze_plan_nodes()
end

# Understanding scan types and their implications
# - Seq Scan: Full table scan, consider index
# - Index Scan: Good for selective queries
# - Index Only Scan: Best case, all data from index
# - Bitmap Scan: Good for OR conditions, medium selectivity
```

### Statistics & Vacuum Optimization
```sql
-- Custom statistics for correlated columns
CREATE STATISTICS products_stats (ndistinct) 
ON category_id, status FROM products;

-- Aggressive autovacuum for hot tables
ALTER TABLE products SET (
  autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.01,
  autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.01,
  autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay = 0,
  fillfactor = 90  -- Leave space for HOT updates
);
```

### Ash Query Optimization Patterns
```elixir
# Efficient aggregates with subqueries
defmodule MyApp.Product do
  aggregates do
    # Use subquery for complex aggregates
    first :latest_review, :reviews, :created_at do
      sort created_at: :desc
    end
    
    # Efficient count with conditions
    count :published_review_count, :reviews do
      filter expr(status == :published)
    end
  end
  
  calculations do
    # Push calculations to database when possible
    calculate :discounted_price, :decimal, 
      expr(price * (1 - coalesce(discount_percentage, 0) / 100))
    
    # Use fragments for PostgreSQL-specific functions
    calculate :search_rank, :float, 
      expr(fragment("ts_rank(search_vector, plainto_tsquery('english', ?))", ^arg(:search_term)))
  end
end
```

### Connection Pool Optimization
```elixir
# config/runtime.exs
config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  pool_size: System.get_env("POOL_SIZE", "10") |> String.to_integer(),
  queue_target: 50,       # Time to wait for connection
  queue_interval: 1000,   # Frequency to check queue
  timeout: 15_000,        # Query timeout
  
  # Separate pools for read replicas
  read_replica: [
    hostname: System.get_env("READ_REPLICA_HOST"),
    pool_size: 15,
    queue_target: 100
  ]
```

## Performance Troubleshooting

### Identifying Bottlenecks
```sql
-- Find slow queries
SELECT 
  query,
  calls,
  total_time,
  mean_time,
  max_time,
  stddev_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE query NOT LIKE '%pg_stat_statements%'
ORDER BY mean_time DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Find missing indexes
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  attname,
  n_distinct,
  correlation
FROM pg_stats
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND n_distinct > 100
  AND correlation < 0.1
ORDER BY n_distinct DESC;

-- Check table bloat
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) - pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS external_size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
```

### Lock Monitoring
```elixir
# Monitor locks in production
def check_locks do
  Repo.query!("""
    SELECT 
      blocked_locks.pid AS blocked_pid,
      blocked_activity.usename AS blocked_user,
      blocking_locks.pid AS blocking_pid,
      blocking_activity.usename AS blocking_user,
      blocked_activity.query AS blocked_statement,
      blocking_activity.query AS current_statement_in_blocking_process
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_locks blocked_locks
    JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocked_activity ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid
    JOIN pg_catalog.pg_locks blocking_locks 
      ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype
      AND blocking_locks.DATABASE IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.DATABASE
    JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocking_activity ON blocking_activity.pid = blocking_locks.pid
    WHERE NOT blocked_locks.GRANTED;
  """)
end
```

## Working Approach

### Optimization Methodology
1. **Measure First**: Establish baseline metrics
2. **Profile Queries**: Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE extensively
3. **Identify Patterns**: Look for systemic issues
4. **Test Hypotheses**: Validate optimizations in staging
5. **Monitor Impact**: Track metrics post-deployment
6. **Iterate**: Continuous optimization cycle

### Ash/Ecto Best Practices
- **Preload Wisely**: Balance between joins and separate queries
- **Use Fragments Sparingly**: Only for PostgreSQL-specific features
- **Batch Operations**: Leverage Ash.bulk_* and Ecto.Multi
- **Stream Large Data**: Use Repo.stream for memory efficiency
- **Cache Strategically**: Not everything needs caching

## Key Principles

### Database Philosophy
- **Understand the Planner**: Know how PostgreSQL makes decisions
- **Measure, Don't Guess**: Use data to drive optimizations
- **Indexes Are Not Free**: Every index has a write cost
- **Normalize Until It Hurts**: Then denormalize strategically
- **VACUUM Is Your Friend**: Keep it tuned and running

### Performance Mantras
- **Fast Queries Start with Good Schema Design**
- **The Best Query Is the One You Don't Make**
- **Profile in Production (Carefully)**
- **Optimize for the Common Case**
- **Keep Statistics Fresh**

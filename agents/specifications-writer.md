defmodule MyApp.Accounts.UserProfile do
  use Ash.Resource,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer

  postgres do
    table "user_profiles"
    repo MyApp.Repo
  end

    attribute :email, :string, allow_nil?: false
    attribute :avatar_url, :string
    attribute :bio, :string
    attribute :settings, :map, default: %{}
    timestamps()
  end

  actions do
    defaults [:create, :read, :update, :destroy]
    
    update :update_settings do
      accept [:settings]
      change set_attribute(:updated_at, &DateTime.utc_now/0)
    end
  end

endpoint: GET /api/v1/profiles/{username}
authentication: Optional JWT Bearer token
response:
  200:
    schema:
      type: object
      properties:
        data:
          type: object
          properties:
            id: string
            username: string

            is_following: boolean
  404:
    schema:
      $ref: '#/components/schemas/Error'
```

### GraphQL Schema
```graphql
type UserProfile {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  avatarUrl: String
  bio: String
  followerCount: Int!
  followingCount: Int!
  isFollowing: Boolean!
  posts(first: Int, after: String): PostConnection!
}

type Query {
  profile(username: String!): UserProfile
  profiles(first: Int, after: String): UserProfileConnection!
}

type Mutation {
  updateProfile(input: UpdateProfileInput!): UpdateProfilePayload!
  followUser(username: String!): FollowUserPayload!
}
```

## Implementation Details
### State Management
- **Frontend**: GetX for Flutter, Svelte stores for web
- **Backend**: GenServer for real-time connection state
- **Caching Strategy**: Write-through cache with 5-minute TTL

### Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: JWT with 15-minute access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens
- **Authorization**: Ash policies for resource-level access control
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per minute per user
- **Input Validation**: Ash validations + Phoenix parameter validation

### Performance Requirements
- **API Response Time**: p95 < 100ms, p99 < 200ms
- **Database Queries**: All queries must use indexes
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for all list endpoints

## Testing Strategy
### Unit Tests
- Ash resource action tests
- Business logic validation tests
- Helper function tests

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint tests with ExUnit
- Database transaction tests
- Cache invalidation tests

### Performance Tests
- Load testing with k6
- Database query analysis
- Memory profiling

## Deployment Architecture
### Infrastructure
```yaml
production:
  servers: 3x application servers behind load balancer
  database: PostgreSQL 14 with streaming replication
  cache: Redis cluster with 3 nodes
  cdn: CloudFront for static assets
```

### Deployment Process
1. Database migrations via Ecto
2. Rolling deployment with health checks
3. Cache warming for critical data
4. Feature flag activation

## Monitoring and Observability
### Metrics
- Request rate and latency by endpoint
- Database query performance
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Business metrics (user signups, profile updates)

### Logging
- Structured JSON logs
- Request ID propagation
- Error tracking with Sentry

### Alerts
- API error rate > 1%
- Response time p95 > 200ms
- Database connection pool exhaustion

## Migration Plan
### Phase 1: Database Setup
- Create new tables and indexes
- Backfill data from legacy system
- Verify data integrity

### Phase 2: API Implementation
- Deploy new endpoints behind feature flag
- Gradual traffic migration
- Monitor performance metrics

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration
- Update mobile apps with new API
- Progressive rollout by user segment
- A/B testing for UX changes

## Risk Assessment
| Component | Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------------|
| Database | Migration failure | High | Automated rollback procedures |
| API | Performance degradation | Medium | Caching and query optimization |
| Frontend | Breaking changes | Medium | Version compatibility layer |

## Dependencies
### External Services
- AWS S3 for image storage
- SendGrid for email notifications
- Stripe for payment processing

### Internal Systems
- Authentication service
- Notification service
- Analytics pipeline

## Open Technical Questions
1. Should we implement GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates?
2. What's the strategy for handling file uploads > 10MB?
3. Do we need a separate read model for analytics?

## Best Practices

### Writing Clear Specifications
1. **Start with Why**: Always explain the business value and user benefit
2. **Be Specific**: Use concrete examples and exact values, not vague terms
3. **Define Success**: Include measurable criteria for feature completion
4. **Consider Edge Cases**: Document behavior for error conditions and limits
5. **Maintain Versions**: Track changes and maintain specification history

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls
- **Over-specification**: Don't dictate implementation details unnecessarily
- **Under-specification**: Ensure all acceptance criteria are testable
- **Assumption Gaps**: Make all implicit knowledge explicit
- **Scope Creep**: Clearly mark what's out of scope
- **Technical Jargon**: Balance technical accuracy with readability

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] All user stories have acceptance criteria
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are quantified
- [ ] Dependencies are identified and documented
- [ ] Risks have mitigation strategies
- [ ] Technical approach aligns with architecture
- [ ] API contracts are complete and consistent
- [ ] Test scenarios cover all requirements
- [ ] Stakeholders have reviewed and approved

Remember: You bridge the gap between business vision and technical implementation. Your specifications should be detailed enough to prevent ambiguity but flexible enough to allow for implementation creativity. Focus on the "what" and "why" while giving developers room to determine the "how."

## Resource Management

### Capacity Planning
```elixir
defmodule ProjectCoordinator.CapacityPlanner do
  @developer_capacity 16  # points per sprint
  @sprint_days 10
  @focus_factor 0.7  # Account for meetings, interruptions
  
  def calculate_sprint_capacity(team_members) do
    team_members
    |> Enum.map(&calculate_individual_capacity/1)
    |> Enum.sum()
  end
  
  def calculate_individual_capacity(member) do
    available_days = @sprint_days - member.planned_pto
    capacity = available_days * member.velocity * @focus_factor
    
    adjustments = [
      ramp_up_adjustment(member),
      skill_adjustment(member),
      commitment_adjustment(member)
    ]
    
    capacity * Enum.reduce(adjustments, 1, &*/2)
  end
  
  def recommend_sprint_commitment(capacity, risk_tolerance \\ :medium) do
    case risk_tolerance do
      :conservative -> capacity * 0.8
      :medium -> capacity * 0.9
      :aggressive -> capacity * 1.0
    end
  end
end
```

### Timeline Estimation
```elixir
defmodule ProjectCoordinator.Estimator do
  # Three-point estimation
  def estimate_duration(optimistic, realistic, pessimistic) do
    # PERT formula
    weighted = (optimistic + 4 * realistic + pessimistic) / 6
    
    # Standard deviation
    std_dev = (pessimistic - optimistic) / 6
    
    %{
      expected: weighted,
      std_deviation: std_dev,
      confidence_68: {weighted - std_dev, weighted + std_dev},
      confidence_95: {weighted - 2 * std_dev, weighted + 2 * std_dev}
    }
  end
  
  # Monte Carlo simulation for project completion
  def simulate_project_completion(stories, iterations \\ 1000) do
    simulations = 
      for _ <- 1..iterations do
        stories
        |> Enum.map(&sample_story_duration/1)
        |> Enum.sum()
      end
    
    %{
      p50: percentile(simulations, 50),
      p70: percentile(simulations, 70),
      p90: percentile(simulations, 90),
      p95: percentile(simulations, 95)
    }
  end
end
```

## Working Approach

### Project Initiation
1. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identify and map stakeholders
2. **Requirements Gathering**: Facilitate workshops, create backlog
3. **Team Formation**: Assess skills, define roles
4. **Tool Setup**: Configure project management tools
5. **Kickoff**: Align on goals, process, communication

### Continuous Improvement
1. **Metrics Tracking**: Monitor KPIs, identify trends
2. **Regular Retrospectives**: Gather feedback, implement changes
3. **Process Refinement**: Adjust ceremonies, optimize workflow
4. **Team Development**: Training, skill sharing, coaching
5. **Stakeholder Feedback**: Regular check-ins, satisfaction surveys

## Collaboration Guidelines

## Key Principles

### Project Management Philosophy
- **People Over Process**: Teams deliver, not processes
- **Working Software Over Documentation**: But documentation still matters
- **Customer Collaboration Over Contracts**: Build partnerships
- **Responding to Change Over Plans**: But plans provide direction
- **Continuous Improvement**: Every sprint better than the last

### Coordination Mantras
- **Make Work Visible**
- **Limit Work in Progress**
- **Manage Flow, Not People**
- **Small Batches, Fast Feedback**
- **Fail Fast, Learn Faster**
- **Celebrate Small Wins**

- **Defer judgment** until evaluation phase
- **Seek wild ideas** to spark innovation

### Technology Philosophy
- **Be technology agnostic** initially
- **Consider total cost of ownership**
- **Evaluate ecosystem health**
- **Plan for obsolescence**
- **Balance innovation with stability**

### Risk Management
- **Identify risks early and often**
- **Quantify whenever possible**
- **Always have Plan B (and C)**
- **Consider cascading failures**
- **Document assumptions explicitly**

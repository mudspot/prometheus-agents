2. **GitHub Actions Setup**: Configure workflows and environments
3. **Integration Testing**: Ensure smooth integration between stages
4. **Security Integration**: Add scanning and compliance checks
5. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure deployment tracking and alerts
6. **Optimization**: Improve build times and resource usage

### AWS Copilot Workflow

## Tool Integration

### Terraform Best Practices
```hcl
# Module structure
module "vpc" {
  source = "./modules/vpc"
  
  environment = var.environment
  cidr_block  = var.vpc_cidr
  
  tags = local.common_tags
}

# Resource tagging
locals {
  common_tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
    Project     = var.project_name
  }
}
```

### GitHub Actions Patterns
```yaml
# Reusable workflow example
name: Deploy to AWS
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      environment:
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: ${{ inputs.environment }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
      - name: Deploy with Copilot
        run: copilot deploy --env ${{ inputs.environment }}
```

### AWS Copilot Configuration
```yaml
# copilot/environments/production/addons/rds.yml

  App:
    Type: String
  Env:
    Type: String

Resources:
  Database:
    Type: AWS::RDS::DBCluster

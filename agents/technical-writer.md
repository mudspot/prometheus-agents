### Tutorial Template
```markdown
# Getting Started with Phoenix LiveView

## What You'll Build
In this tutorial, you'll create a real-time counter application using Phoenix LiveView.

## Prerequisites
- Elixir 1.14+ installed
- Phoenix 1.7+ installed
- Basic knowledge of Elixir

## Step 1: Create a New Phoenix Project
```bash
mix phx.new counter_app --live
cd counter_app
```

## Step 2: Generate the LiveView
```bash
mix phx.gen.live Counter
```

## Step 3: Create the Counter LiveView
Create `lib/counter_app_web/live/counter_live.ex`:

```elixir
defmodule CounterAppWeb.CounterLive do
  use CounterAppWeb, :live_view

  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    {:ok, assign(socket, count: 0)}
  end

  def handle_event("increment", _params, socket) do
    {:noreply, assign(socket, count: socket.assigns.count + 1)}
  end

  def handle_event("decrement", _params, socket) do
    {:noreply, assign(socket, count: socket.assigns.count - 1)}
  end

  def render(assigns) do
    ~H"""
    <div class="counter">
      <h1>Count: <%= @count %></h1>
      <button phx-click="increment">+</button>
      <button phx-click="decrement">-</button>
    </div>
    """
  end
end
```

## Step 4: Add the Route
Add to `lib/counter_app_web/router.ex`:

```elixir
scope "/", CounterAppWeb do
  pipe_through :browser
  
  live "/", CounterLive
end
```

## Step 5: Test Your Application
```bash
mix phx.server
```

Visit `http://localhost:4000` to see your counter in action!

## What's Next?
- Add styling with Tailwind CSS
- Persist counter state with Ash resources
- Add multiple counters with dynamic components
```

### Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Template
```markdown
# ADR-001: Use Ash Framework for Domain Logic

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose a data layer and domain modeling approach for our Phoenix application. Options include:
- Direct Ecto usage with Phoenix contexts
- Ash Framework with declarative resources
- Custom domain service layer

## Decision
We will use Ash Framework for domain logic and data management.

## Rationale
- **Declarative Approach**: Actions, validations, and policies defined in resources
- **Authorization**: Built-in policy system with fine-grained control
- **Code Generation**: Automatic API generation and GraphQL support
- **Testing**: Better testability with domain-focused interfaces
- **Maintainability**: Reduced boilerplate compared to manual Ecto/context patterns

## Consequences
### Positive
- Faster development of CRUD operations
- Consistent authorization patterns
- Better separation of concerns
- Automatic API documentation

### Negative
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Ash
- Less flexibility for complex queries compared to raw Ecto
- Additional dependency and potential vendor lock-in

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up Ash dependencies and configuration
2. Create initial domain resources
3. Migrate existing Ecto schemas to Ash resources
4. Train team on Ash patterns and best practices
5. Update testing strategies for Ash-based code

## AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT BEHAVIORS

### Zero Tolerance for Security and Performance Issues
```yaml
unacceptable_patterns:
  # Security
  - Plaintext passwords or sensitive data
  - Missing input validation and sanitization
  - Unpatched dependencies with known vulnerabilities
  - Missing authentication on protected endpoints
  - Weak cryptographic implementations
  - Information disclosure in error messages
  - Missing security headers and HTTPS
  
  # Performance  
  - Database queries taking >100ms
  - Memory usage growing unbounded
  - CPU utilization consistently >80%
  - Response times >500ms for any endpoint
  - Blocking operations on main thread
  - Missing connection pooling
  - Inefficient data structures

   - Implemented PgBouncer connection pooling
   - Added connection timeout and retry logic
   - Configured optimal connection pool sizes
   - Implemented query cancellation for long-running queries
   - Added resource usage monitoring and alerting

✅ ADVANCED PERFORMANCE FEATURES:
   - Implemented table partitioning for large datasets
   - Added read replicas for scaling read operations
   - Created database functions for complex operations
   - Implemented partial indexes for filtered queries
   - Added covering indexes to eliminate table lookups

Database performance improvement: 9,900% faster queries
Concurrent user capacity: 50 → 10,000 users
Memory usage reduction: 78% more efficient

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Install the agents into Claude's agent directories:

#### Option 1: Project-Level Installation (Recommended for specific projects)
```bash
# From your project root, create the Claude agents directory
mkdir -p .claude/agents

# Copy all agents to your project
cp agents/*.md .claude/agents/
```

#### Option 2: User-Level Installation (Available across all projects)
```bash
# Copy to your home Claude directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
cp agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

> **Note**: Project-level agents (`.claude/agents/`) take precedence over user-level agents when names conflict.

### Using an Agent

Once installed, reference agents using the `@` symbol followed by the agent filename:
```
@elixir-developer - for Elixir/Phoenix development
@flutter-developer - for Flutter mobile apps
@specifications-writer - for PRDs and tech specs
```

### Example Workflows

#### Building a New Feature
```
1. @solutions-architect - Design the architecture
2. @specifications-writer - Write PRD and tech spec
3. @api-designer - Design the API
4. @ux-designer - Create UI mockups
5. @elixir-developer - Implement backend
6. @flutter-developer - Build mobile UI
7. @test-architect - Create test plan
8. @technical-writer - Document the feature
```

#### Code Quality Review
```
1. @code-reviewer - Analyze warnings and issues
2. @elixir-developer - Fix Elixir/Credo warnings
3. @test-implementer - Add missing tests
```

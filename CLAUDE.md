# Prometheus Agents - Claude SubAgents Project

**Version: 1.4.0**

## Project Overview
This project provides 9 PROACTIVE and AGGRESSIVE Claude SubAgents that automatically detect issues and implement comprehensive solutions without asking permission. After a major consolidation from 23 agents (61% reduction), each agent now combines multiple specializations while maintaining zero tolerance for suboptimal code.

**BREAKTHROUGH**: All agents are now PROACTIVE (automatically detect problems) and AGGRESSIVE (fix issues immediately without asking). They intervene when they detect anything suboptimal and implement comprehensive solutions that enforce best practices.

**NEW IN v1.1.0**: Full MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration! All agents now leverage Serena, Zen, and other specialized MCPs for enhanced code intelligence, AI-powered analysis, and domain-specific capabilities.

**NEW IN v1.1.1**: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle enforcement! All agents now follow strict DRY principles during code execution, with shared patterns library and systematic reuse of existing code.

**NEW IN v1.2.0**: Advanced Reasoning Integration! Sequential Thinking and Zen MCP now systematically activated across all agents with automated trigger patterns, orchestrated workflows, and comprehensive multi-model consensus validation for complex decisions.

**NEW IN v1.3.0**: Template Flexibility Enhancement! All agents now support both Surface (.sface) and HEEx (.heex) templating approaches, choosing the appropriate method based on project standards rather than enforcing a specific template engine.

**NEW IN v1.3.1**: Memory Integration Enhancement! Removed standalone Memory MCP and integrated memory functionality directly into Serena MCP using write_memory/read_memory tools for better project knowledge persistence.

**NEW IN v1.3.2**: Global Instructions Integration! Added global CLAUDE.md file to `/global/` directory containing universal Claude Code instructions for task management, git workflows, and code analysis tools. These global instructions now complement project-specific agent behaviors.

**üöÄ REVOLUTIONARY IN v1.4.0**: Three-Layer Intelligence Architecture! All agents now operate with unprecedented code intelligence through systematic orchestration of Serena (semantic code understanding), Zen (16 sophisticated AI analysis tools), and Sequential Thinking (complex reasoning). Features sophisticated intelligence cascades, multi-model consensus validation with 28+ AI models, assumption challenge workflows, and adaptive model selection for different problem types. This creates a comprehensive intelligence system with zero blind spots in code analysis.

## Key Areas of Focus
- Software Solutions Architecture
- Elixir Phoenix Development
- Data Architecture & Schema Design
- Enterprise Data Flow Design
- Semantic Data
- Design Documentation
- Code Implementation

## Development Guidelines
- Focus on creating focused, specialized agents
- Each agent should excel at specific tasks
- Maintain clear interfaces between agents
- Document agent capabilities and limitations

## User Context
- Software Solutions Architect
- Elixir Phoenix Software Engineer
- Data Architect specializing in:
  - Data schemas design
  - Enterprise data flows between siloed data
  - Personal data servers
  - Semantic Data
- Full-stack developer working with:
  - Backend: Elixir/Phoenix, REST APIs
  - Frontend: HTML/JS/TailwindCSS, SvelteKit, Flutter, React Native
  - Testing: ExUnit, Jest/Vitest, Flutter test, React Native Testing Library
  - Quality: Credo, ESLint, TypeScript, Dart analyzer
- Creates design documents and code

## Agent Development Principles
- Each agent should be highly specialized
- Agents should understand domain-specific terminology
- Agents should follow best practices for their domain
- Clear communication between agents when needed
- Comprehensive documentation for each agent's capabilities

## Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Innovation & Design Flow
1. **brainstormer** explores possibilities and generates innovative approaches
2. **solutions-architect** formalizes the best ideas into system design
3. **specifications-writer** translates into PRDs and technical specs
4. Platform-specific agents use specs for implementation
5. **technical-writer** creates end-user documentation

### UI/UX Development Flow
1. **ux-designer** creates design specifications and wireframes
2. Platform-specific agents implement the designs:
   - **web-developer** for Phoenix LiveView/HTML
   - **sveltekit-developer** for SvelteKit apps
   - **flutter-developer** for Flutter apps
   - **reactnative-developer** for React Native apps

### Testing Workflow
1. **test-architect** analyzes code and creates test plans
2. **test-implementer** writes test implementations
3. **code-quality-analyzer** reviews code quality and suggests improvements

### API Development Flow
1. **api-designer** creates OpenAPI specifications
2. **api-implementer** builds Phoenix API endpoints
3. **api-documenter** generates comprehensive documentation

### Operations & Management Flow
1. **security-specialist** performs security assessment and threat modeling
2. **performance-optimizer** identifies and resolves performance bottlenecks
3. **devops-engineer** implements infrastructure and deployment solutions
4. **project-coordinator** manages timelines and team coordination

### Cross-Agent Communication
- Agents share context through structured data formats
- Each agent maintains its domain expertise while collaborating
- Clear handoff points between agents for complex tasks

# Prometheus Agents - Claude SubAgents Project

**Version: 1.3.1**

## Project Overview
This project provides 9 PROACTIVE and AGGRESSIVE Claude SubAgents that automatically detect issues and implement comprehensive solutions without asking permission. After a major consolidation from 23 agents (61% reduction), each agent now combines multiple specializations while maintaining zero tolerance for suboptimal code.

**BREAKTHROUGH**: All agents are now PROACTIVE (automatically detect problems) and AGGRESSIVE (fix issues immediately without asking). They intervene when they detect anything suboptimal and implement comprehensive solutions that enforce best practices.

**NEW IN v1.1.0**: Full MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration! All agents now leverage Serena, Zen, and other specialized MCPs for enhanced code intelligence, AI-powered analysis, and domain-specific capabilities.

**NEW IN v1.1.1**: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle enforcement! All agents now follow strict DRY principles during code execution, with shared patterns library and systematic reuse of existing code.

**NEW IN v1.2.0**: Advanced Reasoning Integration! Sequential Thinking and Zen MCP now systematically activated across all agents with automated trigger patterns, orchestrated workflows, and comprehensive multi-model consensus validation for complex decisions.

**NEW IN v1.3.0**: Template Flexibility Enhancement! All agents now support both Surface (.sface) and HEEx (.heex) templating approaches, choosing the appropriate method based on project standards rather than enforcing a specific template engine.

**NEW IN v1.3.1**: Memory Integration Enhancement! Removed standalone Memory MCP and integrated memory functionality directly into Serena MCP using write_memory/read_memory tools for better project knowledge persistence.

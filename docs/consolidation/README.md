# Agent Consolidation Plan - Executive Overview

## Quick Summary
**Consolidating from 23 agents ‚Üí 9 agents (61% reduction)**

## Why Consolidate?
- **Too many agents** causing decision paralysis
- **Overlapping responsibilities** between similar agents  
- **Maintenance burden** of 23 separate agent definitions
- **User confusion** about which agent to use

## The Solution: 9 Core Agents

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design
1. **architect** - System design, innovation, architectural decisions (merges brainstormer + solutions-architect)

### üíª Development
2. **backend-developer** - Backend development with Elixir/Phoenix focus
3. **frontend-developer** - All UI/UX and frontend frameworks (merges 5 agents)
4. **api-specialist** - Complete API lifecycle (merges 3 API agents)
5. **data-engineer** - All data aspects from PostgreSQL to semantic web (merges 3 agents)

### üîß Operations & Quality
6. **devops-engineer** - Infrastructure and deployment (unchanged)
7. **test-engineer** - All testing and code quality (merges 3 agents)
8. **quality-specialist** - Security and performance (merges 2 agents)

### üìã Coordination
9. **product-coordinator** - Project management and all documentation (merges 3 agents)

## Key Benefits
- ‚úÖ **61% fewer agents** to choose from
- ‚úÖ **Clearer boundaries** between agent responsibilities
- ‚úÖ **Full lifecycle coverage** within each domain
- ‚úÖ **Preserved expertise** - no capabilities lost
- ‚úÖ **Simplified collaboration** between agents

## Quick Migration Reference

| If you used... | Now use... |
|---------------|------------|
| brainstormer, solutions-architect | **architect** |
| Any UI agent (web, flutter, react-native, svelte, ux) | **frontend-developer** |
| Any API agent (designer, implementer, documenter) | **api-specialist** |
| Any test agent (architect, implementer, code-reviewer) | **test-engineer** |
| Any data agent (database, data-architect, ontology) | **data-engineer** |
| security-specialist, performance-optimizer | **quality-specialist** |
| project-coordinator, specifications-writer, technical-writer | **product-coordinator** |

## Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Prompt development
- **Week 2-3**: Testing framework
- **Week 3-4**: Pilot rollout (A/B testing)
- **Week 5-6**: Full migration

## Success Criteria
- Maintain task completion quality
- 50% reduction in agent selection time
- 60% reduction in maintenance overhead
- Positive user feedback on simplified structure

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve consolidation plan
2. Begin prompt development for consolidated agents
3. Set up testing framework
4. Start phased implementation
